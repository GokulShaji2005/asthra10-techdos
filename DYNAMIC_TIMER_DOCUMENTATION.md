# ⏱️ Dynamic Timer Control System Documentation

## Overview

The Dynamic Timer Control system provides comprehensive management of the global 5-hour game timer based on the `game_loaded` field state changes. This system enables precise control over when the timer starts, pauses, and resets, making it ideal for testing and game administration.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Timer Initialization
- **First-time Start**: When `game_loaded` changes from `false` to `true` for the first time, a new 5-hour countdown timer starts
- **Timestamp Recording**: The exact start time is recorded in the `game_start_time` database field

### ✅ Timer Reset on Re-enable
- **Complete Reset**: When `game_loaded` is toggled from `false` back to `true`, the timer completely resets to 5 hours
- **Fresh Start**: Regardless of previous elapsed time, the countdown starts fresh from 5:00:00

### ✅ Timer Pause/Stop
- **Pause Functionality**: When `game_loaded` is set to `false`, the timer effectively pauses for that team
- **State Preservation**: The last `game_start_time` is preserved for reference

### ✅ Real-time Display
- **Dynamic Updates**: Timer displays update every second across all game pages
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for timer states (not started, active, expired)

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Field: `game_start_time`
```sql
-- Added to teams table
game_start_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL
```

**Purpose**: Tracks when the game timer was actually started/restarted
**Values**:
- `NULL`: Game has never been started or is currently stopped
- `TIMESTAMPTZ`: Exact timestamp when the current timer session began

### Migration File
**Location**: `supabase/migrations/003_add_game_start_time.sql`

**Features**:
- Adds `game_start_time` column with proper indexing
- Includes automatic trigger for `game_loaded` state changes
- Backward compatibility for existing teams
- Comprehensive comments and documentation

### Database Trigger
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_game_start_time()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- If game_loaded is being set to true and was previously false
    IF NEW.game_loaded = true AND (OLD.game_loaded = false OR OLD.game_loaded IS NULL) THEN
        NEW.game_start_time = NOW();
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend API Updates

#### Enhanced Team Update Endpoint
**Location**: `app/api/admin/teams/[team_code]/update/route.ts`

**New Logic**:
```typescript
// Handle game_start_time logic when game_loaded changes
const finalUpdateData = { ...updateData }

// If game_loaded is being changed to true, set game_start_time to current timestamp
if (updateData.game_loaded === true && existingTeam.game_loaded === false) {
  finalUpdateData.game_start_time = new Date().toISOString()
}
```

#### Updated Team Interface
```typescript
export interface Team {
  // ... existing fields
  game_start_time: string | null  // NEW FIELD
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### Frontend Timer Logic

#### Utility Functions
**Location**: `lib/supabase.ts`

```typescript
// Get remaining time in milliseconds
export const getGameTimeRemaining = (team: Team): number

// Check if game time has expired
export const isGameTimeExpired = (team: Team): boolean

// Format time as HH:MM:SS
export const formatTimeRemaining = (ms: number): string

// Get current timer status
export const getGameTimerStatus = (team: Team): 'not_started' | 'active' | 'expired'
```

#### Timer Display Logic
**Updated Pages**:
- `/levels` (Levels overview)
- `/levels/level-1` (Individual level pages)

**Features**:
- Real-time countdown updates every second
- Dynamic status indicators
- Automatic expiration handling
- Visual state changes based on timer status

## 🎮 User Experience

### Timer States

#### 1. Not Started (`not_started`)
- **Display**: "Game Not Started" in gray text
- **Icon**: Gray timer icon
- **Condition**: `game_loaded = false` or `game_start_time = null`

#### 2. Active (`active`)
- **Display**: Live countdown (e.g., "04:23:15") in red text
- **Icon**: Red timer icon
- **Condition**: `game_loaded = true` and time remaining > 0

#### 3. Expired (`expired`)
- **Display**: "00:00:00" in red text
- **Icon**: Red timer icon
- **Condition**: `game_loaded = true` and time remaining = 0

### Admin Panel Integration

#### Timer Status Column
- **New Column**: "Timer" in the teams table
- **Status Badges**: 
  - Gray: "Timer: Not Started"
  - Green: "Timer: HH:MM:SS" (remaining time)
  - Red: "Timer: Expired"

#### Team Edit Modal Enhancements
- **Timer Status Display**: Shows current timer state at top of modal
- **Change Warning**: Blue alert when enabling game will reset timer
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for timer state changes

## 🎯 Usage Scenarios

### 1. Level Testing Workflow
```
1. Admin creates test team
2. Admin sets current_level to desired level (e.g., 15)
3. Admin enables game_loaded = true
   → Timer starts fresh 5-hour countdown
4. Team can access level 15 immediately
5. Admin can pause timer by setting game_loaded = false
6. Admin can restart timer by setting game_loaded = true again
   → Timer resets to full 5 hours
```

### 2. Game Administration
```
1. Teams start game normally
   → Timer begins 5-hour countdown
2. Admin can pause specific teams if needed
   → Set game_loaded = false
3. Admin can restart teams with fresh timer
   → Set game_loaded = true (timer resets)
4. Real-time monitoring of all team timers
   → Admin panel shows live countdown for each team
```

### 3. Competition Management
```
1. Multiple teams compete simultaneously
2. Each team has independent timer control
3. Admin can pause/restart individual teams
4. Timer status visible in real-time dashboard
5. Expired teams automatically handled
```

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### API Validation
- **Team Existence**: Verifies team exists before timer operations
- **State Validation**: Ensures proper `game_loaded` state transitions
- **Timestamp Integrity**: Server-side timestamp generation prevents manipulation

### Database Integrity
- **Automatic Triggers**: Database-level enforcement of timer logic
- **Indexed Fields**: Optimized queries for timer operations
- **Consistent Updates**: Atomic operations ensure data consistency

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- **Efficient Updates**: Timer updates only when necessary
